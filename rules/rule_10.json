    "rule_text": "A unit with the 'Anti-Fighter Barrage' ability may be able to destroy an opponentâ€™s fighters at the onset of a battle. During the 'Anti-Fighter Barrage' step of the first round of space combat, players perform the following steps:   10.1 STEP 1-Each player rolls dice for each of his units in the combat that has the 'Anti-Fighter Barrage' ability; this is called an anti-fighter barrage roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit's anti-fighter barrage value.         If a unit has an 'Anti-Fighter Barrage' ability, it is presented on its faction sheet and technology cards.       The 'Anti-Fighter Barrage' ability is displayed as 'Anti-Fighter Barrage X (Y).' The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled.       Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect anti-fighter barrage rolls     10.2 STEP 2:-Each player must choose and destroy one of his fighters in the active system for each hit his opponent's anti-fighter barrage roll produced.    If a player has to assign more hits than he has fighters in the    active system, the excess hits have no effect.         Destroyed       Space Combat"
