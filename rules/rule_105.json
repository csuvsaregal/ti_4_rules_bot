    "rule_text": "Q:  Can the secondary ability of the 'Warfare' strategy card be used to trigger the 'Production' ability of the Arborec's Letani Warriors?    A:  No, the 'Warfare' secondary ability can only be used to trigger the production ability of space docks, and thus cannot be used by the Arborec to produce additional infantry.      Q:  Does the Arborec flagship (The 'Duha Menaimon') need to be in a system when it is activated to make use of its ability?    A:  Yes. The 'Duha Menaimon' can only be used to produce units when it is in a system at the moment it is activated.      Q:  Can the 'Production' abilities of multiple Arborec 'Letani Warriors' in a system be combined to allow the production of two infantry for one resource?    A:  Yes. Production value is totaled when the 'Production' ability of units in a system is used."
