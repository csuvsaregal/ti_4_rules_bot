    "rule_text": "Q:  Can the Creuss Promissory note still be used if the Creuss have not researched 'Wormhole Generator'?    A:  Yes, the promissory not does not require that the 'Wormhole Generator' technology have been researched.      Q:  Can the 'Light/Wave Deflector' technology be used to move through a wormhole created by the Ghosts of Creuss' 'Hil Colish' flagship?    A:  Yes, 'Light/Wave Deflector' would allow a player other than the Ghosts of Creuss to move his fleet through the 'Hil Colish's' system into Creuss system or the Creuss Gate system.      Q:  If the 'Hil Colish' moves before other ships and is returned to reinforcements by a gravity rift, can other ships still use its delta wormhole to reach the active system?    A:  No, the wormhole ceases to exist when the 'Hil Colish' is returned to reinforcements."
