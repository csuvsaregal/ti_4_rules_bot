    "rule_text": "Q:  Does the Naalu flagship ('The Matriarch') allow the Naalu to take gain control of a planet using only fighters?    A:  No. The Naalu fighters return to the space area when ground combat ends. If no Naalu ground forces are present, the combat is considered to be a draw, and the Naalu do not gain control of the planet during the 'Establish Control' step.      Q:  Using the Naalu flagship ('The Matriarch') in combination with the 'Dacxive Animators' technology, can the Naalu gain control of a planet using only fighters?    A:  No. Because the combat ends in a draw, the 'Dacxive Animators' ability is not triggered.      Q:  Does the Naalu '0' token move with the strategy card it is placed on if the card is exchanged with or taken by another player?    A:  No. The Naalu '0' token stays with the Naalu or the faction that gained the token through the 'Gift of Prescience' promissory note and is placed on any of that playerâ€™s strategy cards."
