    "rule_text": "Q:  Can the Mentak Coalition use the 'Salvage Operations' factionspecific technology to produce a war sun that was destroyed if they do not personally have war sun technology?    A:  No. Without war sun technology, they cannot produce a war sun, even using 'Salvage Operations'.      Q:  Can the Mentak Coalition use the 'Salvage Operations' factionspecific technology to produce their own flagship after destroying an opponent's flagship?    A:  Yes, even though the units are technically different, they share the flagship unit type.      Q:  Can the Mentak Coalition use the 'Salvage Operations' factionspecific technology to produce infantry after a combat against the Nekro Virus flagship 'The Alastor' in which Nekro Virus infantry were treated like ships and were subsequently destroyed?    A:  No, the infantry do not count as ships once the combat is over.      Q:   Can the Mentak Coalition use the 'Pillage' faction ability to steal trade goods when they are neighbors with another faction as a result of the 'Lazax Gate Folding' faction technology or 'Quantum Entanglement' faction ability?    A:  Yes, even in the case of 'Quantum Entanglement' only being active from the Creuss’ point of view, because the ‘neighbor’ status is active as a result of the ability, the Mentak may use their 'Pillage' in these situations.      Q:  Can the Mentak Coalition use the 'Pillage' faction ability for each time the Saar gain a trade good from the 'Scavenge' faction ability in a single turn, provided that the other requirements are met?    A:  Yes. The Mentak can trigger 'Pillage' each time the Saar gain control of a planet, if all the conditions of 'Pillage' are met."
