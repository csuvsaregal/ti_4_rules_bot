    "rule_text": "A unit with the 'Bombardment' ability may be able to destroy another player's ground forces during an invasion. During the 'Bombardment' step of an invasion, players perform the following steps:   15.1 STEP 1- The active player chooses which planet each of his units that has a 'Bombardment' ability will bombard. Then he rolls dice for each of those units; this is called a bombardment roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit's 'Bombardment' value.         If a unit has a 'Bombardment' ability, it is presented on its faction sheet and technology cards.       The 'Bombardment' ability is displayed as 'Bombardment X (Y).' The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all 'Bombardment' abilities have a (Y) value; a bombardment roll for such a unit consists of one die.       Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect bombardment rolls.       Multiple planets in a system may be bombarded, but a player must declare which planet a unit is bombarding before making a bombardment roll.       The L1Z1X's 'Harrow' ability does not affect the L1Z1X player's own ground forces.       Planets that contain a unit with the 'Planetary Shield' ability cannot be bombarded.     15.2 STEP 2- The player who controls the planet that is being bombarded chooses and destroys one of his ground forces on that planet for each hit result the bombardment roll produced.    If a player has to assign more hits than he has ground forces, the excess hits have no effect.          Invasion       Planetary Shield"
