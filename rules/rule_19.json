    "rule_text": "Command tokens are a currency that players use to perform actions and expand their fleets.   19.1 A player begins the game with eight command tokens on his command sheet: three in his tactic pool, three in his fleet pool, and two in his strategy pool.         Command tokens in the strategy and tactic pool are placed with the faction symbol faceup.       Command tokens in the fleet pool are placed with the ship silhouette faceup.     19.2 When a player gains a command token, he chooses which of the three pools on his command sheet to place it in.   19.3 A player is limited by the amount of command tokens in his reinforcements.         If he would gain a command token but has none available in his reinforcements, he cannot gain that command token.       If a game effect would place a player's command token onto the board from his reinforcements and none are available, he must take a token from one of the pools on his command sheet, unless the system already contains one of his command tokens.     19.4 During the action phase, a player can perform a tactical action by spending a command token from his tactic pool; he places the command token in a system.   19.5 After a player performs a strategic action during the action phase, each other player can resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card by spending a command token from his own strategy pool.   19.6 If a game effect would place a playerâ€™s command token in a system where he already has one, he places the token in his reinforcements instead. Any effects that resolve by placing that token are resolved as normal.    A player does not spend a command token to resolve the secondary ability of the 'Leadership' strategy card.
