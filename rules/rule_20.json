    "rule_text": "Commodities represent goods that are plentiful for their own faction and are desired by other factions. A commodity has no inherent game effects, but converts into a trade good if given to or received from another player.   20.1 Commodities and trade goods are represented by opposite sides of the same token.   20.2 The commodity value on a player's faction sheet indicates the maximum number of commodities he can have.   20.3 When an effect instructs a player to replenish commodities, he takes the number of commodity tokens necessary so that the amount of commodities he has equals the commodity value on his faction sheet. Then, he places those tokens so their commodity sides are faceup in the commodity area of his faction sheet.   20.4 When a player replenishes commodities, he takes the commodity tokens from the supply.   20.5 Players can trade commodities following the rules for transactions. When a player receives a commodity from another player, the player who received that token converts it into a trade good by placing it in the trade good area of his command sheet with the trade good side faceup.         That token is no longer a commodity token; it is a trade good token.       A player can trade commodity tokens before resolving a game effect that allows him to replenish commodities.     20.6 Any game effect that instructs a player to give a commodity to another player causes that commodity to be converted into a trade good.   20.7 A player cannot spend commodities; he can only trade them during a transaction.   20.8 Commodity tokens come in values of one and three. A player can swap between these tokens as necessary.         Deals       Trade Goods       Transactions"
