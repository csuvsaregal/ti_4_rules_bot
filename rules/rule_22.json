When placing units, if a player does not have enough units in his reinforcements, he can remove units from any systems that do not contain one of his command tokens and place them in his reinforcements. Then, he can place any units that he removed. He cannot remove units in this way unless he is immediately placing a unit of that type. Abilities cannot force a player to remove and place a unit in this manner.       When producing a fighter or infantry unit, a player can use a fighter or infantry token, as appropriate, from thesupply instead of a plastic piece. These tokens must be accompanied by at least one plastic piece of the same type; players can swap infantry and fighter tokens for plastic     pieces at any time.   22.5 CARDS: When a deck is depleted, players shuffle the deck's discard pile and place it facedown to create a new deck.
