    "rule_text": "The 'Construction' strategy card allows players to construct structures on planets they control. This card's initiative value is '4.'   23.1 During the action phase, if the active player has the 'Construction' strategy card, he can perform a strategic action to resolve that card's primary ability.   23.2 To resolve the primary ability on the 'Construction' strategy card, the active player may place either one PDS or one space dock on a planet he controls. Then, he may place an additional PDS on a planet he controls.         The structures can be placed on the same planet or different planets.       The structures can be placed in any systems, regardless of whether the player has a command token in the system or not.     23.3 After the active player resolves the primary ability of the 'Construction' strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may place one command token from his strategy pool in any system. If he already has a command token in that system, the spent token is returned to his reinforcements instead. Then, he places either one PDS or one space dock on a planet he controls in that system.   23.4 When a player places either a PDS or space dock using the 'Construction' strategy card, he takes that PDS or space dock from his reinforcements.    If a player does not have enough units in his reinforcements, he can remove units from any systems that do not contain one of his command tokens and place them in his reinforcements. Then, he must place this unit on the game board as instructed by the effect placing the unit.          Initiative Order       Strategic Action       Strategy Card       Structures"
