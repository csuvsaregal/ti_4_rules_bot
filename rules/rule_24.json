    "rule_text": "Each player begins the game with control of the planets in his home system. During the game, players can gain control of additional planets.   24.1 When a player gains control of a planet, he takes the planet card that corresponds to that planet and places it in his play area; that card is exhausted.    If a player is the first player to control a planet, he takes the    planet card from the planet card deck.    If another player controls the planet, he takes that planet's card from the other player's play area.    24.2 A player cannot gain control of a planet that he already controls.   24.3 While a player controls a planet, that planet's card remains in his play area until he loses control of that planet.   24.4 A player can control a planet that he does not have any units on; he places a control token on that planet to mark that he controls it.   24.5 Except during the invasion step of a tactical action, a player loses control of a planet if he no longer has units on it andanother player has units on it         The player that placed units on the planet gains control of that planet.       During the invasion step of a tactical action, control is determined during the 'Establish Control' step.     24.6 A player can also lose control of a planet through some game effects.   24.7 If a player loses control of a planet that contains his control token, he removes his control token from the planet.
