    "rule_text": "A deal is an agreement between two players that may or may not include a transaction that involves physical components.   27.1 Players can make deals with each other at any time, even if they are not neighbors. However, deals that include a transaction must follow the rules for transactions, including that the players be neighbors.   27. 2 Deals are binding or non-binding according to the conditions of the deal.   27. 3 If the terms of a deal can be resolved immediately, it is a binding deal. When a deal is binding, a player must adhere to the terms of the agreement and whatever transactions, if any, were agreed upon.    The results of playing an action card, including the act of successfully resolving a card, are not instantaneous and cannot be guaranteed. They cannot be part of a binding deal.    27.4 If the terms of a deal cannot be resolved immediately, it is a non-   binding deal. When a deal is non-binding, a player does not have to adhere to any part of the agreement if he chooses not to.         Promissory Notes       Trade Goods"
