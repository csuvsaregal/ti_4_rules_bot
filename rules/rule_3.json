    "rule_text": "During the action phase, each player takes a turn in initiative order. During a player's turn, he performs a single action. After each player has taken a turn, player turns begin again in initiative order. This process continues until all players have passed.   3.1 During a player's turn, he may perform one of the following three types of actions: a strategic action, a tactical action, or a component action.   3.2 If a player cannot perform an action, he must pass.   3.3 After a player has passed, he takes no further turns and cannot perform additional actions during that action phase.         A player can still resolve transactions and 'at the start of your turn' abilities on the turn that he passes only.       A player that has passed can still resolve the secondary ability of other players' strategy cards.       It is possible for a player to perform multiple, consecutive actions during an action phase if all other players have passed during that action phase.     3.4 A player cannot pass until he has performed a strategic action.    During a three-player or four-player game, a player cannot pass until he has exhausted both of his strategy cards.    3.5 After all players have passed, play proceeds to the status phase.
