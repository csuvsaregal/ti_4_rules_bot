    "rule_text": "The 'Diplomacy' strategy card can be used to preemptively prevent other players from activating a specific system. It can also be used to ready planets. This card's initiative value is '2.'   30.1 During the action phase, if the active player has the 'Diplomacy' strategy card, he can perform a strategic action to resolve that card's primary ability.   30.2 To resolve the primary ability on the 'Diplomacy' strategy card, the active player chooses a system that contains a planet he controls other than the Mecatol Rex system and readies any of his exhausted planets in that system. Then, each other player places one command token from his reinforcements on that system.         If a player has no command tokens in his reinforcements, he places one of his choice from his command sheet.       If a player already has a command token in the chosen system, he does not place a command token there.     30.3 After the active player resolves the primary ability of the 'Diplomacy' strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from his strategy pool to ready up to two exhausted planets he controls.
