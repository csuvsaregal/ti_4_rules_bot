    "rule_text": "A gravity rift is an anomaly that affects movement.   37.1 A ship that will move out of or through a gravity rift at any time during its movement, applies +1 to its move value.    This can allow a ship to reach the active system from farther away than it normally could.    37.2 For each ship that would move out of or through a gravity rift, one die is rolled immediately before it exits the gravity rift system; on a result of 1–3, that ship is removed from the board.         Dice are not rolled for units that are being transported by ships with capacity.       Units that are being transported are removed from the board if the ship transporting them is removed from the board.        Units that are removed are returned to the player’s reinforcements           Anomalies       Movement"
