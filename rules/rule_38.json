    "rule_name": "GROUND COMBAT",
    "rule_text": "During the 'Invasion' step of a tactical action, if the active player commits ground forces to land on a planet that contains another player's ground forces, those players resolve a ground combat on that planet. To resolve a ground combat, players perform the following steps:   38.1 STEP 1-ROLL DICE: Each player rolls one die for each ground force he has on the planet; this is a combat roll. If a unit's combat roll produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit's combat value, that roll produces a hit.    If a unit's combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls one die for each burst icon instead.14    38.2 STEP 2-ASSIGN HITS: Each player must choose one of his ground forces on the planet to be destroyed for each hit result his opponent produced.    When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes it from the board and places it in his reinforcements.    38.3 After assigning hits, if both players still have ground forces on the planet, players resolve a new combat round starting with the 'Roll Dice' step.   38.4 Ground combat ends immediately when only one player (or neither player) has ground forces on the planet.         'End of combat' and 'end of combat round' effects still occur.       After a combat ends, the player with one or more ground forces remaining on the planet is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser of the combat.       If neither player has a ground force remaining, then there is no winner; the combat ends in a draw.           Invasion       Planets"
