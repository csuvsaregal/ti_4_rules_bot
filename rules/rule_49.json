    "rule_text": "A player can move his ships by resolving a tactical action during the action phase. Additionally, some abilities can move a unit outside of the tactical action.   49.2 TACTICAL ACTION MOVEMENT   49.3 Most ships have a move value printed on their faction sheets and technology cards. This value indicates the distance from its current system that a ship can move.   To resolve movement, players perform the following steps:   49.4 STEP 1-MOVE SHIPS: A player can move any number of his eligible ships into the active system, obeying the following rules:         The ship must end its movement in the active system.       The ship cannot move through a system that contains ships that are controlled by another player.       The ship cannot move if it started its movement in another system that contains one of its faction's command tokens.       The ship can move through systems that contain its own faction's command tokens.       The ship can move out of the active system and back into it if its move value is high enough.       The ship must move along a path of adjacent systems, and the number of systems the ship enters cannot exceed its move value.     49.5 When a ship with a capacity value moves or is moved, it may transport ground forces and fighters.   49.6 The active player declares which of his ships are moving before any ships move. Those ships arrive in the active system simultaneously.   49.7 STEP 2-SPACE CANNON OFFENSE: After the 'Move Ships' step, players can use the 'Space Cannon' abilities of their units in the active system.   49.8 ABILITY MOVEMENT   49.9 If an ability moves a unit outside of the 'Movement' step of a tactical action, players follow the rules specified by that ability; neither a unit's move value nor the rules specified above apply.         Action Phase       Active System       Capacity       Space Cannon       Tactical Action       Transport"
