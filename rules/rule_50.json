    "rule_text": "A nebula is an anomaly that affects movement and combat.   50.1 A ship can only move into a nebula if it is the active system.    A ship cannot move through a nebula. That is, a ship cannot move into and out of a nebula during the same movement.    50.2 A ship that begins the 'Movement' step of a tactical action in anebula treats its move value as '1' for the duration of that step.    Other abilities and effects can increase this number.    50.3 If a space combat occurs in a nebula, the defender applies +1 to the combat rolls of his ships during that combat.         Anomalies"
