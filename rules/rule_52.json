    "rule_text": "Players can score objectives to gain victory points.   52.1 There are two types of objective cards: public objectives and secret objectives.    Each public objective has a 'I' or 'II' on the back of its card; all other objectives are secret objectives.    52.2 Each objective card indicates a number of victory points that a player gains by scoring that objective.   52.3 Each objective card indicates the phase during which a player can score that objective-either the status phase or action phase.   52.4 Each objective card describes the requirement a player must fulfill to score that objective.   52.5 If a player fulfills the requirement described on an objective card, he can score that objective following the timing indicated on the card, either during the action phase or the status phase.         When a player scores an objective during the status phase, he must fulfill the requirement on the card during the 'Score Objectives' step of the status phase to score that objective.       When a player scores an objective during the action phase, he can do so at any time during that phase.     52.6 A player can score a maximum of one public objective and one secret objective during each status phase.   52.7 A player can score any number of objectives during a turn of the action phase; however, he can only score one objective during each combat.    A player can score an objective during both the space combat and the ground combat during the same tactical action.    52.8 A player can score each objective only once during the game.   52.9 If an objective requires a player to destroy one or more units, those units can be destroyed by producing hits against them, playing action cards, using technology, or any number of other abilities that use the 'destroy' terminology.    Forcing a player to remove a unit from the board by reducing the number of command tokens in his fleet pool does not count as destroying a unit.    52.10 Players can score some objectives by spending resources, influence, or tokens, as described by the objective card. To score such an objective, a player must pay the specified cost at the time indicated on the card.   52.11 PUBLIC OBJECTIVES   A public objective is an objective that is revealed to all players.   52.12 When scoring a public objective, the player places one of his control tokens on that objective's card. Then, he advances his control token on the victory point track a number of spaces equal to the number of victory points he gained.   52.13 Each game contains five stage I and five stage II public objective cards that the speaker places facedown near the victory point track during setup.    The speaker reveals two of the stage I objective cards during setup. All other objective cards remain facedown.    52.14 During each status phase, the speaker reveals a facedown public objective card.    The speaker does not reveal stage II objective cards until all stage I objective cards are revealed.    52.15 If the speaker must reveal a facedown public objective card but all public objective cards are already revealed, the game ends immediately.    The player with the most victory points is the winner. If one or more players are tied for having the most victory points, the tied player who is first in initiative order is the winner.    52.16 A player cannot score public objectives if he does not control each of the planets in his home system.18   52.17 SECRET OBJECTIVESA secret objective is an objective that is controlled by one player and is hidden from all other players until it is scored.   52.18 When scoring a secret objective, a player reveals the objective by placing it faceup in his play area. Then, he places one of his control tokens on that objective's card and advances his control token on the victory point track a number of spaces equal to the number of victory points he gained.   52.19 A player can only score his own secret objectives; he cannot score secret objectives revealed by other players.   52.20 Each player begins the game with one secret objective.   52.21 Each player can have up to three total scored and unscored secret objectives.    If a player draws a secret objective and has more than three, he must choose one of his unscored secret objectives and return it to the deck. Then, he shuffles the secret objective deck.    52.22 A player can gain secret objectives by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the 'Imperial' strategy card.         Imperial       Status Phase       Victory Points"
