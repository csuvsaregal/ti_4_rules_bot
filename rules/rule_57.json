    "rule_text": "The 'Politics' strategy card allows players to draw action cards. Additionally, the active player chooses a new speaker and may be able to look at cards in the agenda deck. This card's initiative value is '3.'   57.1 During the action phase, if the active player has the 'Politics' strategy card, he can perform a strategic action to resolve that card's primary ability.   57. 2 To resolve the primary ability on the 'Politics' strategy card, the active player resolves the following effects in order:   i. The active player chooses any player that does not have the speaker token. He may choose himself as long as he does not have the speaker token. The chosen player places the speaker token in his play area; he is now the speaker.   ii. The active player draws two action cards.   iii. The active player secretly looks at the top two cards of the agenda deck. Then, he places each card on either the top or the bottom of the deck. If he places both cards on either the top or bottom, he can place them in any order.   57. 3 After the active player resolves the primary ability of the 'Politics' strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from his strategy pool to draw two action cards.
