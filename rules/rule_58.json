    "rule_text": "The primary way in which a player produces new units is by resolving the 'Production' abilities of his units during a tactical action. However, other game effects also allow players to produce units.   58.1 Each unit that a player can produce has a cost value presented on its faction sheet or technology card. To produce a unit, a player must spend a number of resources from planets he controls equal to or greater than the cost value of the unit he is producing.         Any resources spent in excess of a unit's cost are lost.       If a player is producing multiple units at a time, he can add the cost of all the units he is producing to create a total cost before he spends any resources.     58.2 If the cost is accompanied by two icons-typically forfighters and ground forces-a player produces two of that it for that cost.         Each of the two units counts toward the total number of units a player can produce.       A player can choose to produce only one unit; however, he must still pay the entire cost.     58.3 When a player produces a unit through the use of his units' 'Production' abilities during a tactical action, he follows the rules of the 'Production' ability to determine where he can place his units in the active system.   58.4 When a player produces a unit through an ability outside of the tactical action, that ability will state where the player can place the units he is producing and how many units he can produce.   58.5 A player is limited by the number of units in his reinforcements.         If he does not have enough units in his reinforcements, he can remove units from any systems that do not contain one of his command tokens and place them in his reinforcements. Then, he can produce any units that he removed. He cannot remove a unit in this way unless he is immediately producing a unit of that type.       When producing a fighter or infantry unit, he can use a fighter or infantry token, as appropriate, from the supply instead of a plastic piece.     58.6 A player cannot produce ships in a system that contains other players' ships, but he can still produce ground forces.
