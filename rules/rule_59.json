    "rule_text": "During the 'Production' step of a tactical action, the active player can resolve the 'Production' ability of each of his units that are in the active system in order to produce units.   59.1 A unit's 'Production' ability on its faction sheet is always followed by a value. This value is the maximum number of units that this unit can produce.         If the active player has multiple units in the active system that have the 'Production' ability, he can produce a number of units up to the combined total of all of his units' production values in that system.20       When producing fighters or infantry, each individual unit counts toward the producing unitâ€™s production limit.       A player can choose to produce one fighter or infantry instead of two, but he must still pay the full cost.       'Production' value from Arborec space docks cannot be used to produce infantry, even if the Arborec player controls other units with 'Production' in the same system.     59.2 When a player produces ships by using 'Production', he must place them in the active system.   59.3 When a player produces ground forces, he must place those unit on planets that contain a unit that used its 'Production' ability.   59.4 If a player uses the 'Production' ability of a unit in a space area of a system to produce ground forces, those ground forces may either be placed on a planet the player controls in that system or in the space area of that system.    If a player places a ground force in the space area of a system, it cannot exceed that player's capacity in that system.          Blockaded       Producing Units       Space Dock"
