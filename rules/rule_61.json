    "rule_text": "Cards have a readied state, which indicates that a player can exhaust or resolve the abilities on those cards.   61.1 A card that is readied is placed faceup in a player's play area; a card that is exhausted is placed facedown in a player's area.   61.2 A player can exhaust a readied planet card to spend resources or influence from that card's planet.   61.3 A player can exhaust certain readied technology cards to resolve those cards' abilities.    Such a technology will specifically instruct a player to exhaust the card as part of the ability's cost.    61.4 If a card is exhausted, a player cannot resolve that card's abilities or spend resources or influence on that card until it is readied.   61.5 During a 'Ready Cards' step, each player readies all of his exhausted cards by flipping them faceup.   61.6 When a player performs a strategic action, he exhausts his chosen strategy card.    That card is later readied during the status phase.          Abilities       Exhausted       Status Phase"
