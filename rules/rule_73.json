    "rule_text": "During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card to use during the round.   To resolve the strategy phase, players perform the following steps:   73.1 STEP 1-Starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses one of the strategy cards from the common play area and places it faceup in his play area.         If there are one or more trade good tokens on a strategy card when a player chooses it, he gains those trade goods.       A player cannot choose a strategy card that another player has already chosen during the current strategy phase.       When playing with three or four players, each player will choose a second strategy card. After the last player has received his first strategy card, each player choosesa second strategy card, starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise.     73.2 STEP 2-The speaker places one trade good token from the supply on each strategy card that was not chosen.    During a four-player game, all strategy cards will be chosen, and therefore no trade good tokens will be placed on strategy cards.    Then, players proceed to the action phase.
