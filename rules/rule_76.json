    "rule_name": "SUSTAIN DAMAGE (UNIT ABILITY)",
    "rule_text": "Some units have the 'Sustain Damage' ability. Immediately before a player assigns damage to his units, he can use the 'Sustain Damage' ability of any of his units in the active system.   76.1 For each 'Sustain Damage' ability that a player uses, one hit produced by another player's units is canceled. Then, each unit using this ability is placed on its side to indicate that it is damaged.   76.2 A damaged unit does not have reduced capabilities and is functionally the same as an undamaged unit, except that it cannot use the 'Sustain Damage' ability.   76.3 A damaged unit cannot use the 'Sustain Damage' ability until it is repaired during the status phase or by another game effect.   76.4 A unit can use its 'Sustain Damage' ability any time a hit is produced against it. This includes hits produced during combat and from unit abilities such as the 'Space Cannon' ability.    A unit can only use the 'Sustain Damage' ability if it is eligible to be hit. For example, a player cannot use a dreadnought's 'Sustain Damage' ability to cancel a hit from 'Anti-Fighter Barrage.'    76.5 The 'Sustain Damage' ability cannot be used to cancel an effect that directly destroys a unit.   76.6 The Barony of Letnev's 'Non-Euclidean Shielding' faction technology allows the Letnev player's units with the 'Sustain Damage' ability to cancel up to two hits instead of one.         Abilities       Ground Combat       Space Combat"
