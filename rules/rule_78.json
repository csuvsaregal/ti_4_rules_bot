    "rule_name": "TACTICAL ACTION",
    "rule_text": "The tactical action is the primary method by which players produce units, move ships, and extend their dominion within the galaxy. To perform a tactical action, the active player performs the following steps:   78.1 STEP 1-ACTIVATION: The active player must activate a system that does not contain one of his command tokens.         To activate a system, the active player places a command token from his tactic pool on that system. That system is the active system.       Other players' command tokens do not prevent a player from activating a system.     78.2 STEP 2-MOVEMENT: The active player may move any number of ships with a sufficient move value from any number of systems that do not contain one of his command tokens into the active system, following the rules for movement.         Ships that have capacity values can transport ground forces and fighters when moving.       The player may choose to not move any ships.       After the 'Move Ships' step, all players can use the 'Space Cannon' abilities of their units in the active system.     78.3 STEP 3-SPACE COMBAT: If two players have ships in the active system, those players must resolve a space combat.    If the active player is the only player with ships in the system, he skips this step.    78.4 STEP 4-INVASION: The active player may use his 'Bombardment' abilities, commit units to land on planets, and resolve ground combat against other players' units.   78.5 STEP 5-PRODUCTION: The active player may resolve the 'Production' abilities of his units in the active system.    The active player may do this even if he did not move units or land ground forces during this tactical action.
