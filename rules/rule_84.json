    "rule_text": "When a ship moves, it may transport any combination of fighters and ground forces, but the number of units it transports cannot exceed that ship's capacity value.   84.1 The ship can pick up and transport fighters and ground forces when it moves. During a tactical action, it can pick up and transport units from the active system, the system it started its movement in, and each system it moves through.         These transported units remain with the transporting ship until it is finished moving.       Units being transported by a ship that is removed from the board by a gravity rift are also removed from the board.     84.2 Any fighters and ground forces that a ship transports must move with the ship and remain in the space area of a system.   84.3 Fighters and ground forces cannot be picked up from a system that contains one of their faction's command tokens other than the active system.   84.4 A player can land ground forces on a planet in a system during the 'Invasion' step of a tactical action.
