During the action phase, if the active player has the 'Warfare' strategy card, he can perform a strategic action to resolve that card's primary ability.   To resolve the primary ability on the 'Warfare' strategy card, the active player performs the following steps:   88.1 STEP 1-The active player removes any one of his command tokens from the game board. Then, he gains that command token by placing it in one of the pools of his command sheet.   88.2 STEP 2-The active player can redistribute the command tokens among the pools on his command sheet.   88.3 After the active player resolves the primary ability of the 'Warfare' strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from his strategy pool to resolve the 'Production' ability of one space dock in his home system.    The command token is not placed in his home system.          Action Phase       Command Tokens       Initiative Order       Strategy Card       Strategic Action"
